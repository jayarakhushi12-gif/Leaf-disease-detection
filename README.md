# Leaf-disease-detection
An AI-powered leaf disease detector that sends images to Groq’s multimodal Llama 4 model and returns structured, actionable results. Users can upload leaf photos via a Streamlit UI, or call the FastAPI endpoint, and receive disease name, type, severity, confidence, symptoms, causes, disease density, and both general and chemical treatment recommendations.
